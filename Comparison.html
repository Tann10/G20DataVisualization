            Companies use the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) to compare a firm's market capitalization to its book
            value. It's calculated by dividing the company's stock price per share by its book value per share (BVPS).
            Book value is also the tangible net asset value of a company calculated as total assets minus intangible
            assets (.e.g. patents, goodwill) and liabilities.
            <ol>
                <li>The P/B ratio measures the market's valuation of a company relative to its book value</li>
                <li>The market value of equity is typically higher than the book value of a company</li>
                <li>P/B ratio is used by value investors to identify potential investments</li>

        The price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) relates a company's share price to its earnings per share.
        A high P/E ratio could mean that a company's stock is over-valued, or else that investors are expecting high
        growth rates in the future.
        Companies that have no earnings or that are losing money do not have a P/E ratio since there is nothing to put
        in the denominator.
        Two kinds of P/E ratios - forward and trailing P/E - are used in practice.
        <br>
        In general, a high P/E suggests that investors are expecting higher earnings growth in the future compared to
        companies with a lower P/E. A low P/E can indicate either that a company may currently be undervalued or that
        the company is doing exceptionally well relative to its past trends. When a company has no earnings or is
        posting losses, in both cases P/E will be expressed as “N/A.” Though it is possible to calculate a negative P/E,
        this is not the common convention.
